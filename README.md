# Job Recommendation System
- Deployed Link https://job-recommendation-system420.streamlit.app/
This project implements a Job Recommendation System using natural language processing techniques and deep learning models. It provides recommendations based on the similarity between a user-provided resume (either as text input or uploaded PDF) and a database of job listings.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Converts text to lowercase and removes non-alphanumeric characters for consistency.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Computes similarity scores using TF-IDF vectors of job descriptions.
- **BERT Embeddings**: Utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for deep contextualized embeddings of job descriptions.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between user input and job listings using cosine similarity metric.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: Provides an interactive UI for users to input their job preferences and receive recommended job listings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - streamlit
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - PyPDF2
  - joblib
  - torch
  - transformers

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
- To run the application locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
## How it Works
### Input Types
- Text Input: Users can directly enter their job role, skills, and career goals.
- Upload PDF: Users can upload their resume in PDF format, and the system extracts text for analysis.
### Processing
- Text Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares input text for analysis.
- TF-IDF Similarity: Computes similarity scores using TF-IDF vectors of job descriptions.
- BERT Embeddings: Calculates deep embeddings of job descriptions using BERT.
## Recommendation
- Combines TF-IDF and BERT similarity scores to generate top job recommendations.
- Displays recommended jobs along with company name, job title, description, required skills, and location.

## Folder Structure

### Explanation

- **`app.py`**: This file contains the script for the Streamlit application, which is used to run the job recommendation system.
  
- **`new_job_details.csv`**: A sample dataset containing job details such as company, job title, description, skills, and location.

- **`job_embeddings.npy`**: This file stores pre-computed embeddings of job descriptions, likely generated using a machine learning model or algorithm.

- **`tfidf_vectorizer.joblib`**: Serialized TF-IDF vectorizer used to transform job descriptions into numerical vectors for similarity computation.

- **`job_vectors.joblib`**: Serialized TF-IDF vectors of job descriptions, likely used for efficient retrieval and computation.

- **`README.md`**: The markdown file you are currently viewing, serving as the documentation and overview of the project.

- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing all Python dependencies required to run the project, typically used with `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
